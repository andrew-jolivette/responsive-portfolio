            <p class="content-text">I grew up in Menlo Park, California and like so many my age, surrounded by the tech boom of the 90s.  Heavily influenced by computers and the "beginning of the internet", between summer camps and my own expirimentation, I taught myself how to construct basic websites with HTML and utilizing cutting edge, free webhosts such as AngelFire and Yahoo! Pages, my embedded MIDI files were infamous amongst the poor souls who happened across my pages. However, as I started to transition from High School to College, my interests began to veer away from coding HTML and writing stories.  I ultimately pursued a bachelor's degree in Creative Writing from Sonoma State University (after a not-so-brief obsession with a certain popular MMORPG of the early to late 2000s) and quickly realized after graduation how "useful" my degree ultimately was.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="content-text">I spent the following years shifting my focus once again, away from writing and little by little more into graphic design.  Between the jobs I held working at a print/copy shop and then again at a winery designing and printing wine labels, I learned a lot.  But all this came to a head after working for an eCommerce company where I had the opportunity to combine my knowledge of Graphic Design, my dusty Creative Writing degree and my almost long-forgotten love of building websites.  Immediately, my time working for that company rekindled my love for web design and development.   </p>
                <br>
            <p class="content-text">And that is where I am today, finally combining all my passions into one focus.  Always learning and always pushing what I can do.</p>
